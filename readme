These are some of the dotfiles that I have developed over time. The bashrc is
nice, as it shows when you are working in a git directory and what the current
working branch is. The vimrc file has some functions that I use (avoiding ESC
and using jk to break out of insert mode).

A WORD OF WARNING: The installation script will overwrite your old dotfiles!
However, the script does preserve the last version of dotfiles in the directory
~/olddots/
